		<td><h3>ABOUT HARLEY DAVIDSON</h3>Harley, is an American motorcycle manufacturer, founded in Milwaukee, Wisconsin in 1903. 
		The key people behind it are William S. Harley,

As one of two major American motorcycle manufacturers to survive the Great Depression. 
The company has survived numerous ownership arrangements, subsidiary arrangements (e.g., Aermacchi 1974-1978 and Buell 1987-2009), 
periods of poor economic health and product quality, as well as intense global competition[6]
to become the world's fifth largest motorcycle manufacturer and an iconic brand widely known for its loyal following 
with owner clubs and events worldwide as well as a company sponsored brand-focused museum.

Harley-Davidson manufactures its motorcycles at factories in York, Pennsylvania; 
Milwaukee, Wisconsin; Kansas City, Missouri; Manaus, Brazil; and Bawal, India and markets its products worldwide.
